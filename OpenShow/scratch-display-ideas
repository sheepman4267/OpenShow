right click on a slide should have the option "force to display > select a display"
should be able to select what display to preview in the show controls - this would allow one to make a "preview" display separate from the main display, to test transitions etc (DONE)
use an iframe for the preview (DONE)
maybe use an iframe for the *whole* preview, even in slide editor- would fix the damn CSS conflicts
add displays to show controls sidebar (DONE)
somewhere we need an editable settings system, with default displays
decks need default transitions, times - settable (DONE)
decks need "create slides from images" (customizable element class!!!)
